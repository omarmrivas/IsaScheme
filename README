WINDOWS INSTALLATION

1) Create a theory file. The name of the theory is not important but you must import IsaLibs.

theory MyTheory
imports IsaLibs
begin

end

2) Create a new settings file or edit your existing one to include the following path. Note that IsaLibs comes with a working timeout tool.

TIMEAOUT_PATH=path_to_timeout

e.g.

TIMEAOUT_PATH=/cygdrive/c/Users/Omar/Programs/IsaLibs

3) Download the AProVE termination prover (command line version) from the link and place it on the same directory of your theory file (see step 1).

http://aprove.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/

4) Run the following command to build the heap image and work with your theory

isabelle jedit -d path_to_IsaLibs_root_file -l IsaLibs your_theory.thy
